# Development Scripts
These scripts exist outside of the intent of the home-assistant/core repo (especially the upstream). They exist to facilitate the development work of this fork, allowing for easy operations such as:
- keeping the fork (and the "main" branch of the fork) up to date with the upstream [[link](update_main.sh)]
- running a debug session on a development instance
  - including fetching a config from production
- deploying modifications made in this fork to a prod instance [[link](deploy_to_board)]
